# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the email-agent project. ADRs document important architectural decisions made during the development of this project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are short text documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development of a software project. Each ADR describes the context, decision, alternatives considered, and consequences of a particular architectural choice.

## ADR Format

All ADRs in this project follow a consistent format defined in [template.md](template.md). Each ADR includes:
- **Context**: The situation that led to the decision
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated
- **Consequences**: The positive, negative, and neutral outcomes

- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## Contributing

When making significant architectural decisions:
1. Create a new ADR using the template
2. Number it sequentially (ADR-XXX)
3. Discuss with the team before marking as "Accepted"
4. Update this index when adding new ADRs
