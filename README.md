# Gmail Labeler — AI-Powered Email Organization

Automatically organize your Gmail inbox with AI-powered email labeling. Your emails are categorized into actionable labels like `reply_needed`, `review`, `todo`, and `summarize` — all running in Google's cloud with no servers to manage.

## What This Does

This system automatically analyzes your incoming Gmail and sorts it into four actionable categories:

- **`reply_needed`** — Emails requiring your personal response (questions, meeting requests, urgent items) — automatically creates draft replies with AI
- **`review`** — Informational emails to read (updates, newsletters, FYI messages)
- **`todo`** — Action items and tasks (assignments, deadlines, follow-ups)
- **`summarize`** — Long emails that benefit from AI summarization

**Example**: A meeting invitation gets labeled `reply_needed`, while a weekly newsletter gets labeled `review`.

## Quick Start

**Time required**: 5-10 minutes
**Experience needed**: None — we'll guide you through every step

### Prerequisites

- **Google account** with Gmail access
- **Node.js 18+** (install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install node`)
- **5-10 minutes** for setup

### Step 1: Install Google Apps Script CLI

```bash
npm install -g @google/clasp
clasp login --no-localhost
```

This connects the command-line tool to your Google account.

### Step 2: Get a Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project (e.g., "Gmail Labeler")
3. Enable "Generative Language API" (search for it)
4. Go to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
5. Click "Create credentials" → "API key"
6. Copy the API key (looks like `AIzaSyC-abc123...`)

### Step 3: Create and Deploy the Project

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-agent.git
cd email-agent

# Create the Apps Script project
npm run create

# Upload code to Google's cloud
npm run push

# Open the Apps Script editor
npm run open
```

### Step 4: Configure Settings

In the Apps Script editor that just opened:

1. Click **"Project Settings"** in the left sidebar
2. Scroll down to **"Script properties"**
3. Click **"Add script property"** and add:

| Property Name | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Your API key from Step 2 |
| `DRY_RUN` | `true` *(optional: test mode)* |
| `DEBUG` | `true` *(optional: verbose logging)* |

### Step 5: Test It

1. In the Apps Script editor, select **`run`** from the function dropdown
2. Click the **"Run"** button (▶️)
3. **Authorize the script** when prompted:
   - Click "Review permissions"
   - Choose your Google account
   - Click "Advanced" → "Go to Gmail Labeler (unsafe)"
   - Click "Allow"
4. Check the **"Execution log"** at the bottom for results
5. Check your **Gmail** — you should see new labels applied to emails

**Testing tip**: Set `DRY_RUN=true` to analyze emails without actually applying labels.

## Congratulations!

You now have AI-powered email labeling! Your Gmail will automatically organize emails into helpful categories.

**What's next?** You can run the script manually anytime by clicking "Run" in the Apps Script editor, or set up automatic scheduling (see below).

---

## Optional: Automatic Scheduling

Make it run every hour automatically:

1. In the Apps Script editor, select **`installTrigger`** from the function dropdown
2. Click **"Run"** button (▶️)
3. Grant permissions when prompted
4. Verify in the **"Triggers"** section (left sidebar)

Your emails will now be labeled automatically every hour without your computer needing to be on.

## Advanced Features (Optional)

The core email labeling is complete! These advanced features are optional add-ons:

### Reply Drafter Agent

**What it adds**: Automatic draft replies for emails labeled `reply_needed`

Perfect for generating professional, context-aware draft responses to questions, meeting requests, and routine correspondence. AI analyzes the full email thread and creates drafts you can review and send.

**How it works**:
- Immediate draft creation for newly-classified emails (agent handler)
- Every 30 minutes, processes ALL `reply_needed` emails in inbox (scheduled batch)
- Comprehensive coverage for manually labeled emails, retries, and historical emails

**Quick configuration example**:
```
REPLY_DRAFTER_ENABLED = true
REPLY_DRAFTER_INSTRUCTIONS_URL = https://docs.google.com/document/d/YOUR_DOC_ID/edit
```
**Setup**: Install scheduled batch trigger with `installReplyDrafterTrigger` function in Apps Script editor.

## Quick Troubleshooting

### Everything gets labeled as `review`

**Solution**: Increase analyzed email content:
```
BODY_CHARS = 2000
```

Or customize with the [Knowledge System](docs/features/knowledge-system.md).

### "API key invalid" errors

**Solution**:
1. Double-check your API key in Script Properties
2. Verify "Generative Language API" is enabled in Google Cloud Console
3. Check with IT admin if using work account (API restrictions)

### "Authorization required" messages

**Solution**: Re-run the authorization process:
1. In Apps Script editor, click "Run" button
2. Click "Review permissions" and allow access

### Script times out or runs slowly

**Solution**: Reduce processing limits:
```
MAX_EMAILS_PER_RUN = 10
BATCH_SIZE = 5
```

### No emails being processed

**Solution**:
1. Enable debug mode: `DEBUG = true`
2. Check execution logs for details
3. Verify you have recent emails without existing labels

**For more help**: See the [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/guides/troubleshooting.md)

| `DEBUG` | `false` | Verbose logging for troubleshooting |
| `MAX_EMAILS_PER_RUN` | `20` | Maximum emails to process each run |
| `BUDGET_HISTORY_DAYS` | `3` | Days to retain budget tracking properties |

**For complete configuration reference**: See [Configuration Guide](docs/guides/configuration.md)

---

## Security and Privacy

- **Your API key**: Keep it private — never commit to code repositories
- **Permissions**: Script only accesses Gmail to read emails and manage labels
- **Data**: Email content sent to Google's Gemini AI for analysis (not stored permanently)
- **Revoke access**: Remove permissions anytime in [Google Account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)

---

## How It Works

### Architecture

The system runs entirely in Google's cloud using **Google Apps Script**:

1. **Scheduled trigger** runs hourly (or manually)
2. **Finds unlabeled emails** in your Gmail inbox
3. **Sends email content** to Gemini AI for classification
4. **Applies appropriate labels** based on AI analysis
5. **Budget tracking** prevents API quota overruns

### Why Google Apps Script?

- **No server needed**: Runs in Google's cloud, not on your computer
- **Built-in Gmail access**: No complex authentication setup
- **Free to run**: Generous free quotas for personal use
- **Automatic scheduling**: Runs on its own without your computer being on

### Key Design Decisions

- [Four-label classification system](docs/adr/003-label-based-classification.md) for simplicity
- [Pluggable agent architecture](docs/adr/004-pluggable-agents.md) for extensibility
- [Batch processing with budget management](docs/adr/005-batch-processing-budget.md)
- [Dual authentication modes](docs/adr/006-dual-authentication.md) (API key or Vertex AI)
